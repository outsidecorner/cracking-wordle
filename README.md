# cracking-wordle
A small script to calculate the best Wordle starting word. Very basic statistics (I don't know much about the field), so please let me know if you have any suggestions!

This uses the list of 20k most common English words from this [repo](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english), created by [Josh Kaufman](https://github.com/first20hours) and based on the Google Trillion Word Corpus.
